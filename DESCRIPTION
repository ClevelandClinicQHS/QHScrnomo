Description: Nomogram is constructed to predict cumulative incidence
    rate, which is calculated by adjusting for competing causes other
    than that of interest. K-fold cross-validation function is implemented
    to validate the performance. Competing risk version of concordance index
    is calculated. Methods are as described in: Kattan MW, Heller G, 
    Brennan MF (2003) <doi:10.1002/sim.1574>.
