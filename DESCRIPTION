Description: Nomograms are constructed to predict the cumulative incidence
    rate which is calculated after adjusting for competing causes to the event of interest. 
    K-fold cross-validation is implemented to validate predictive accuracy using a competing-risk version of the concordance index.
    Methods are as described in: Kattan MW, Heller G, 
    Brennan MF (2003).
